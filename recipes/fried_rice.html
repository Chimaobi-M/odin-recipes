    <p> <b> Easy to cook </b></p><br><br>
    <p>I have always loved fried rice. I could probably eat an entire bowl. The great thing about this recipe is that 
        you can add whatever you would like! I have added bacon, chicken, and ham. It is the perfect fried rice base 
        and they say the secret ingredient to get the authentic Chinese taste is sesame oil. Whatever it may be it is fantastic!</p>
    <p>I always serve this amazing fried rice with all of my Chinese dishes. It is easy and goes perfectly as a side</p>    
    <br><br><p><b>Ingredients</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li> White long grain rice- Day old and cold rice help to keep it from being mushy.</li>
        <li>Small white onion</li>  
        <li>Vegetables- Peas and Carrots.  You can also add in other veggies such as bell pepper, broccoli, cauliflower, asparagus, snow peas and cabbage.</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Sesame Oil</li> 
        <li>Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>Green Onions- Garnish with adding in sliced green onions right at the end!</li><br><br>
    </ul>    
    <p><b>Cooking steps</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat Skillet. Turn your skillet to medium high heat and pour sesame oil into the bottom of your skillet and add the onion, peas and carrots. Fry this until they are tender.</li>
        <li>Slide the veggies to the side. Pour the beaten eggs onto the other side. Use a spatula to scramble the eggs. Mix them together with the veggies.</li>
        <li>Add the rice. Combine it with the veggie and egg mixture. Pour the soy sauce on top and stir until it is heated throughout. Garnish with green onions.</li>
