  <p>fried yam</p><br>
  <p><b>Introduction</b></p><br>
  <p>Fried yam is a deep-fried yam recipe that can be eaten with a wide range of Nigerian stews and sauces. 
    It is fried in such a way that the outside of the chips is crunchy while the inside is moist.</p><br>
  <p><b>Ingredients</b></p><br>
  <ul>
    <li>White yam</li>
    <li>Vegetable oil</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Steps</b></p><br>
  <ol>
    <li>Peel and cut the yam tuber into 1 inch cylindrical discs. Make several cuts across the discs to get large chips. 
        Wash the yam chips and place in a bowl.</li>
    <li>Add a little salt and toss the contents to distribute the salt.</li>
    <li>If you are using a deep fryer, pour enough vegetable oil into the fryer as per the instructions manual and preheat the oil to 170Â°C. 
        You can also use a pot to fry the yam chips. It is preferable to use a pot rather than a frying pan for this fried yam recipe because 
        pots provide more depth for the frying process.</li>
    <li>When the oil is heated, add a few yam chips, leaving enough room for flipping the chips.</li>
    <li>Stir the chips till they have turned golden.</li>
    <li>Remove the chips and place in paper towels to absorb the oil.</li>
    <li>Fry the rest of the chips following steps 4 through 6.</li>
</ol>
